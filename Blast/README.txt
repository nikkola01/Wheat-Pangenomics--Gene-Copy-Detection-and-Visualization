This is the documentation for the project that involves creating a protein database using BLAST, running a search against a sample file, and saving the results in two separate files.

Project Overview
The protein database was created using the input file data.fa.
The database was run against the sample file 1.fa.
The search results were saved in the files myresults.txt and result.out.

Files
data.fa: The input file containing protein sequences used to create the protein database using BLAST.
1.fa: The sample file containing protein sequences that were searched against the created protein database.
myresults.txt: The output file containing the search results in a user-friendly format.
result.out: The output file containing the search results in a more detailed, machine-readable format.

Please ensure you have all the required files to reproduce the results or to modify the project as needed.
