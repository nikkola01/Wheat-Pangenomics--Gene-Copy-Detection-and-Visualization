This is the documentation for the project that involves creating a protein database, running a search against a sample file, and saving the results in a text file.

Project Overview
1. The protein database was created using the input file diamond iwgcsProt1A_prime_only.fa.
2. The database was run against the sample file sample.fa.
3. The search results were saved in the file matches.txt.

Files
1. iwgcsProt1A_prime_only.fa: The input file containing protein sequences used to create the protein database.
2. sample.fa: The sample file containing protein sequences that were searched against the created protein database.
3. matches.txt: The output file containing the search results.

Please ensure you have all the required files to reproduce the results or to modify the project as needed.
